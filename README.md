# Samsung Debloat Script

## About
This is my personal debloat script for one of my demo devices. It only removes minor things, not a full debloat. If you would like to do a full debloat, I recommend W1nst0n's [Universal Android Debloater](https://github.com/0x192/universal-android-debloater).

## Dependencies
* ADB
* Android Device Drivers if using Windows

## Download and Run
1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://www.gitlab.com/Plexer0/Samsung-Debloat-Script`
2. Launch your terminal, setup ADB, and make sure it's in your PATH.
3. Run the script appropriate to your OS: <br>
**Windows: SAMdebloat.bat** <br>
**MacOS/Linux: SAMdebloat.sh**

NOTE: It is possible to run this script on Android alone with a rooted device, but this hasn't been properly tested, so your mileage may vary.
